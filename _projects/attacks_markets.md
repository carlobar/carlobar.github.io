I have analyzed possible cyber attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the infrastructure of
electricity markets. For example, an adversary can compromise IoT devices to manipulate
the information that costumers use to make decisions (e.g., prices of electricity). Such attacks
can change the system’s state as well as the market equilibrium, which can in turn benefit
some of the market’s participants or cause blackouts. Similar works have been proposed
in the literature; however, they often consider heuristic attacks. On the contrary, in this
work I formulate the ideal goal of an attacker and then find the precise attack that can
be implemented to achieve such outcome. Part of this research also focused on designing
detection schemes and penalties to make this kind of attacks unprofitable.
