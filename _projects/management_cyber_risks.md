This line of research deals with the optimal allocation of resources to manage cyber risks,
that is, protect systems against cyber threats. This problem is important because there
are several types of protections that perform different tasks and firms need to find the
combination of tools that bests suits them. In this project I modeled the dynamic interaction
between an attacker and a defender with a Markov process, where the defender can invest in
three protection schemes, namely prevention (e.g., secure code development), detection (e.g.,
intrusion detection systems), and cyber insurance. Unlike other models, this project assumes
that the defender cannot penalize the attackers, since in many cases the responsible of cyber
crimes remains anonymous or cannot be prosecuted. I investigate the optimal strategies of
both defender and attacker using stochastic dynamic programming.

This research has contributed to understand the role of insurance to handle cyber risks.
First, uncertainties in the actions of attackers make insurance more attractive. Moreover,
insurance can improve the investment in either prevention or detection, when the premium is
high or low, respectively. However, the defender needs incentives to purchase cyber insurance,
but insurance alone doesn’t guarantee an adequate protection level. Concretely, policies with
unlimited coverage can lead to perverse incentives that degrade the investments in security.
