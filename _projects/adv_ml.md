This area has caught the attention of many researchers in the last years. While most
efforts focus on analyzing the vulnerabilities of ML classifiers, I analyzed vulnerabilities of
load forecast systems, which play a fundamental role in the operation of power systems.
An increasing demand for precise forecasts motivates the design of complex models that
use information from different sources, such as smart appliances. This research showed that
an adversary can induce over or under estimations of load (consumption of electricity) by
compromising some smart appliances. I propose a moving target defense mechanism that
introduces uncertainties through an ensemble of predictors. The structure of the ensemble
follow the equilibira of a Stackelberg game, where the defender decides first the structure of
the prediction systems and the attacker then chooses its attack strategy.
