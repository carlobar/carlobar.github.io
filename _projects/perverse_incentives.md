Some challenges in cyber security are not necessarily technical. On the contrary, some
issues arise due to the lack of economic incentives. For example, the market logic of minimizing costs to maximize profit lead to insecure products. A perfect example of this is the
SolarWinds hack (2020). Likewise, perverse economic incentives can also motivate attacks. I
have studied incidents of real attacks on electricity towers motivated by greed and facilitated
by information asymmetries. Concretely, I formulated a game between contractors and a
power transmission company to show how misaligned incentives enabled contractors to profit
by colluding with guerrilla groups. I also analyze how to modify the contractual policies
reducing the incentives to collude with guerrillas.

<p>In 2007   93% of the attacks on towers took place in the same region. Since 2005 
   a repair company conspired with terrorists to attack electricity towers  </p>
