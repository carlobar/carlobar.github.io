New technologies introduced with smart grids can allow users to actively participate
in electricity markets, e.g., selling energy stored in batteries, or scheduling consumption
strategically. Without a proper coordination the selfish behavior of users can degrade the
the efficiency of electricity markets (this phenomenon is also known as the tragedy of the
commons or the price of anarchy). My research focused on designing economic incentives to
coordinate the demand of customers and reduce the market’s efficiency loss. I found that,
unlike competitive markets, in regulated markets the efficiency loss can be arbitrarily large.
Also, without coordination users can consume at most twice the optimal amount of energy.
To mitigate such negative results I leveraged the mechanism design theory (or inverse game
theory) to find an economic incentive that improves the efficiency of the market.
