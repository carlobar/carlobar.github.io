I have worked on diverse problems concerning cyber insurance, in particular, mechanisms
to address some barriers that prevent the adoption of cyber insurance. Cyber insurance is a
mechanism with two critical roles in cybersecurity. The first is to manage the risk of cyber
incidents, e.g., deal with losses and provide expertise to recover from incidents. The second
consists in creating incentives to invest in cyber protections (firms that make an effort to
reduce their cyber risk may pay lower premiums). These are crucial elements to deal with the
increased frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks; however, cyber insurance markets
have not developed as expected. Insurers face some challenges to achieve these goals, in
part, because it is difficult to assess cyber risks (data about cyber incidents is scarce and
the cyber threats evolve in time). The following is a summary of the projects on this field

## Analyse regulations on data sharing for insurers

A proposal to address data scarcity consists in enforcing data sharing among insurers. This
is a desirable outcome, because each insurer may make better risk estimations (and with a
well developed cyber insurance market society may be better protected). However, we find
that such policies can lead to undesirable outcomes. Concretely, insurers may become free
riders, that is, they may make less efforts gathering data (e.g., make security assessments)

## Investigate strategies for leaning risks

Insurers often have insufficient data to assess cyber risks, but still, the market of cyber
insurance is very attractive. Successful insurers must balance both the exposure to cyber
threats and the potential gains (profit and data to estimate risks) that results from offering
coverage. We study strategies that insurers can use to learn risks when data can be acquired
either by offering policies or by conducting security assessments.

## Study the impact of software diversity in cyber insurance

One of the main barriers to cover cyber risks is the possibility of aggregate risk, which
occurs when a single incident raises multiple claims simultaneously. This is concerning
because an insurer may lack the capacity to pay the losses arising from a widespread cyber
attack. Unlike other risks, this correlation of claims can be reduced for some cyber risks.
Concretely, we study how some security practices, like software diversity, can facilitate the
coverage of cyber risks by reducing the correlation between successful cyber attacks.
