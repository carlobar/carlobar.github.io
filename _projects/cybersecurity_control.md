The security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), like industrial control systems, has become
a priority due to successful cyber attacks that damage physical processes. Some examples of
such security incidents are: Stuxnet (2010), attacks on the Ukraine’s power system (2015,
2016), Triton attack against a petrochemical company in Saudi Arabia (2017), and a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline (2021). My research in this area focused on using
control theory to model CPS, build threat models, and study mechanisms to make such
systems resilient against cyber attacks.
