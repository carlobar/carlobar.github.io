I have analyzed possible cyber attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the infrastructure of
electricity markets. For example, an adversary can manipulate the information sent to users
(e.g., prices) to change their behavior. Likewise, the attacker can target the messages sent
by customers (e.g., bids of energy). Alternatively, an adversary can compromise IoT devices
directly to alter their response to the market’s signals. These attacks change the power
system’s state and the market equilibrium, which can either benefit some of the market’s
participants or break the system. Part of this research has focused on designing detection
schemes and designing penalties to make unprofitable this kind of attacks. Similar works
have been proposed in the literature; however, they often consider heuristic attacks. On the
contrary, in this work I formulate the ideal goal of an attacker and then find the precise
attack that can be implemented to achieve such outcome.
