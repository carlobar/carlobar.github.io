<blockquote><font size="-1">
In this work, we study the vulnerabilities of protection systems that can detect cyber-attacks in power grid systems. We show that machine learning-based discriminators are not resilient against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. In particular, we demonstrate that an adversarial actor can launch DoS attacks on specific sensors, render their measurements useless and cause the attack detector to classify a more sophisticated cyber-attack as a normal event. As a result of this, the system operator may fail to take action against attack-related faults leading to a decrease in the operation performance. To realize a DoS attack, we present an optimization problem to determine which sensors to attack within a given budget such that the existing classifier can be deceived. For linear classifiers, this optimization problem can be formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. In this paper, we extend this optimization problem to find attacks for more complex classifiers such as neural networks. We demonstrate that a neural network, in particular, with RELU activation functions, can be represented as a set of logic formulas using Disjunctive Normal Form, and the optimization problem can be used to efficiently compute a DoS attack. In addition, we propose a defense model that improves the resilience of neural networks against DoS through adversarial training. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of the approach using a dataset for classification in power systems.

Power grids are undergoing major changes due to the rapid adoption of intermittent renewable energy resources and the increased availability of energy storage devices. These trends drive smart-grid operators to envision a future where peer-to-peer energy trading occurs within microgrids, leading to the development of Transactive Energy Systems. Blockchains have garnered significant interest from both academia and industry for their  potential application in decentralized TES, in large part due to their high level of resilience. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of attacks against blockchain based TES, which target the gateways that connect market participants to the system. We introduce a general model of blockchain based TES and study multiple threat models and attack strategies. We also demonstrate the impact of these attacks using a testbed based on GridLAB-D and a private Ethereum network. Finally, we study how to mitigate these attack.

Load forecast systems play a fundamental role the operation in power systems, because they reduce uncertainties about the system's future operation. An increasing demand for precise forecasts motivates the design of complex models that use information from different sources, such as smart appliances. However, untrusted sources can introduce vulnerabilities in the system. For example, an adversary may compromise the sensor measurements to induce errors in the forecast. In this work, we assess the vulnerabilities of load forecast systems based on neural networks and propose a defense mechanism to construct resilient forecasters.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The modernization of the power system introduces technologies that may improve the system’s efficiency by enhancing the capabilities of users. Despite their potential benefits, such technologies can have a negative impact. This subject has widely analyzed, mostly considering for-profit electric utilities. However, the literature has a gap regarding the impact of new technologies on non-profit utilities. In this work, we quantify the price of anarchy of non-profit utilities, that is, the cost caused by lack of coordination of users. We find that users, in the worst case, can consume up to twice the optimal demand, obtaining a small fraction of the optimal surplus. For this reason, we leverage the theory of mechanism design to design an incentive scheme that reduces the inefficiencies of the system, which preserves the privacy of users. We illustrate with simulations the efficiency loss of the system and show two instances of incentive mechanism that satisfy either budget balance and budget deficit.

Most security defenses can be breached by motivated adversaries, therefore in addition to attack-prevention technologies, firms investing in cyber-security for their information technology infrastructure  need to consider attack-detection and restoration tools to detect intruders, and restore their system to a safe condition.  Attackers face similar  investment  alternatives; they  need to invest resources to finding vulnerabilities in a protected system, and once the protection has been broken, they need to invest  in the infrastructure necessary to exploit these attacks and maintain stealthy persistence in the compromised infrastructure.  We model this dual considerations as a dynamic programming problem between attackers and defenders and then study the Nash equilibrium of this game.

We illustrate the potential of applying population games in two key related problems in microgrids management: 1) economic dispatch of active and reactive power; and 2) demand response. For the dynamic economic dispatch problem, we present a hierarchical microgrid energy management algorithm able to dispatch active and reactive power dynamically. In the second case, we use an opinion dynamics model, including the market in which the network agents interact. Opinion dynamics considers individuals who shape their beliefs based on information they receive from a subset of the society and offers tools to analyze the outcome of collective decision processes, which apparently can be considered arbitrary. We propose an opinion dynamics model including some desired characteristics, such as prominent agents and environmental incentives.

In particular, we prove that while previous models lower the demand, they do not guarantee that they will try to flatten the demand. We then introduce a new nonlinear piece-wise continuous electricity cost function to model the way several consumers (from small utilities to retail consumers) are billed for electricity consumption. We show that the new cost function lowers the peaks in DR programs and design new incentive mechanisms to ensure that distributed agents converge to the Pareto-efficient solution of the system. However, we prove that any incentives mechanism either imposes additional taxes or requires external subsidies to operate. The paper finalizes with two examples of such mechanisms.

Demand response systems assume an electricity retail-market with strategic electricity consuming agents. The goal in these systems is to design load shaping mechanisms to achieve efficiency of resources and customer satisfaction. Recent research efforts have studied the impact of integrity attacks in simplified versions of the demand response problem, where neither the load consuming agents nor the adversary are strategic.
In this paper, we study the impact of integrity attacks considering strategic players (a social planner or a consumer) and a strategic attacker. We identify two types of attackers: (1) a malicious attacker who wants to damage the equipment in the power grid by producing sudden overloads, and (2) a selfish attacker that wants to defraud the system by compromising and then manipulating control (load shaping) signals. We then explore the resiliency of two different demand response systems to these fraudsters and malicious attackers. Our results provide guidelines for system operators deciding which type of demand-response system they want to implement, how to secure them, and directions for detecting these attacks.

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are monitored and controlled by a wide variety of sensors and controllers. However, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that most of the devices interacting with the physical world (sensors and controllers) are extremely fragile to security incidents. One particular technology that can help us improve the trustworthiness of these devices is software attestation. While software attestation can help a verifier check the integrity of devices, it still has several drawbacks that have limited their application in the field, like establishing an authenticated channel, the inability to provide continuous attestation, and the need to modify devices to implement the attestation procedure. To overcome these limitations, we propose CPS-attestation as an attestation technique for control systems to attest their state to an external verifier. CPS-attestation enables a verifier to continuously monitor the dynamics of the control system over time and detect whether a component is not behaving as expected or if it is driving the system to an unsafe state. Our goal in this position paper is to initiate the discussion on the suitability of applying attestation techniques to control systems and the associated research challenges.

We prove the inefficiency (in the sense of Pareto) of the electricity system, as well as its resemblance with the tragedy of the commons. Also, we present a mechanism intended to achieve efficiency in the electricity consumption by means of economic incentives. The proposed incentives might be seen as an indirect revelation mechanism, in which users do not have to reveal private information about their preferences. Instead, a particular incentive is calculated for each user, based solely on its relative consumption. We conclude that the success of the proposed mechanism requires subsidies from external institutions, at least during the transition between an inefficient outcome and the efficient equilibrium.

We formulate a detailed adversary model that considers different levels of privilege for the attacker such as read and write access to information flows. We then study the impact of these attacks and propose reactive countermeasures based on game theory. In one case-study we use a basic differential game, and in the other case study we introduce a heuristic game for stability.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
In this paper, the design of a population dynamics model based on both opinion and imitator dynamics is presented. This approach is focused on the analysis of some population behaviors such as the emergence of either consensus or disagreement, information aggregation, and spread of misinformation. The analysis of these properties is made in the context of network populations with or without the presence of prominent agents and environmental incentives. Some simulation results illustrate the ideas presented in this paper.

 Adaptive fuzzy equalization based on neuron grouping for time-varying

<blockquote><font size="-1">
This paper presents an approach for time varying non-linear channel equalization based on fuzzy systems and single-neuron training. The method consists of two stages: the first one uses supervised learning in order to determine channel states and to provide an initial tuning of the fuzzy equalizer parameters. The second one dynamically adjusts the equalizer to follow the varying behavior of the channel through unsupervised learning. This proposal is compared with a radial basis network over the equalization of a time-varying communication channel reported in previous works. Experiments are carried out through Monte Carlo simulations. Results show that the proposed approach presents a performance than that of a radial basis function in terms of the bit error rate of a communication system.
