 Duopoly insurers’ incentives for data quality under a mandatory

<blockquote><font size="-1">
We study the impact of data sharing policies on cyber insurance markets. These policies have been proposed to address the scarcity of data about cyber threats, which is essential to manage cyber risks. We propose a Cournot duopoly competition model in which two insurers choose the number of policies they offer (i.e., their production level) and also the resources they invest to ensure the quality of data regarding the cost of claims (i.e., the data quality of their production cost). We find that enacting mandatory data sharing sometimes creates situations in which at most one of the two insurers invests in data quality, whereas both insurers would invest when information sharing is not mandatory. This raises concerns about the merits of making data sharing mandatory.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Due to the increased deployment of novel communication, control and protection functions, the grid has become vulnerable to a variety of attacks. Designing robust machine learning based attack detection and mitigation algorithms require large amounts of data that rely heavily on a representative environment, where different attacks can be simulated. This paper presents a comprehensive tool-chain for modeling and simulating attacks in power systems. The paper makes the following contributions, first, we present a probabilistic domain specific language to define multiple attack scenarios and simulation configuration parameters. Secondly, we extend the PyPower-dynamics simulator with protection system components to simulate cyber attacks in control and protection layers of power system. In the end, we demonstrate multiple attack scenarios with a case study based on IEEE 39 bus system.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
As smart meters continue to be deployed around the world collecting unprecedented levels of fine-grained data about consumers, we need to find mechanisms that are fair to both, (1) the electric utility who needs the data to improve their operations, and (2) the consumer who has a valuation of privacy but at the same time benefits from sharing consumption data. In this paper we address this problem by proposing privacy contracts between electric utilities and consumers with the goal of maximizing the social welfare of both. Our mathematical model designs an optimization problem between a population of users that have different valuations on privacy and the costs of operation by the utility. We then show how contracts can change depending on the probability of a privacy breach. This line of research can help inform not only current but also future smart meter collection practices.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
In this work, we study the vulnerabilities of protection systems that can detect cyber-attacks in power grid systems. We show that machine learning-based discriminators are not resilient against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. In particular, we demonstrate that an adversarial actor can launch DoS attacks on specific sensors, render their measurements useless and cause the attack detector to classify a more sophisticated cyber-attack as a normal event. As a result of this, the system operator may fail to take action against attack-related faults leading to a decrease in the operation performance. To realize a DoS attack, we present an optimization problem to determine which sensors to attack within a given budget such that the existing classifier can be deceived. For linear classifiers, this optimization problem can be formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. In this paper, we extend this optimization problem to find attacks for more complex classifiers such as neural networks. We demonstrate that a neural network, in particular, with RELU activation functions, can be represented as a set of logic formulas using Disjunctive Normal Form, and the optimization problem can be used to efficiently compute a DoS attack. In addition, we propose a defense model that improves the resilience of neural networks against DoS through adversarial training. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of the approach using a dataset for classification in power systems.

Blockchains have garnered significant interest from both academia and industry for their potential application in decentralized TES, in large part due to their high level of resilience. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of attacks against blockchain based TES, which target the gateways that connect market participants to the system. We introduce a general model of blockchain based TES and study multiple threat models and attack strategies.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Recent advances in machine learning enable wider applications of prediction models in cyber-physical systems. Smart grids are increasingly using distributed sensor settings for distributed sensor fusion and information processing. Load forecasting systems use these sensors to predict future loads to incorporate into dynamic pricing of power and grid maintenance. However, these inference predictors are highly complex and thus vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Moreover, the adversarial attacks are synthetic norm-bounded modifications to a limited number of sensors that can greatly affect the accuracy of the overall predictor. It can be much cheaper and effective to incorporate elements of security and resilience at the earliest stages of design. In this paper, we demonstrate how to analyze the security and resilience of learning-based prediction models in power distribution networks by utilizing a domain-specific deep-learning and testing framework. This framework is developed using DeepForge and enables rapid design and analysis of attack scenarios against distributed smart meters in a power distribution network. It runs the attack simulations in the cloud backend. In addition to the predictor model, we have integrated an anomaly detector to detect adversarial attacks targeting the predictor. We formulate the stealthy adversarial attacks as an optimization problem to maximize prediction loss while minimizing the required perturbations. Under the worst-case setting, where the attacker has full knowledge of both the predictor and the detector, an iterative attack method has been developed to solve for the adversarial perturbation. We demonstrate the framework capabilities using a GridLAB-D based power distribution network model and show how stealthy adversarial attacks can affect smart grid prediction systems even with a partial control of network.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The modernization of the power system introduces technologies that may improve the system’s efficiency by enhancing the capabilities of users. Despite their potential benefits, such technologies can have a negative impact. This subject has widely analyzed, mostly considering for-profit electric utilities. However, the literature has a gap regarding the impact of new technologies on non-profit utilities. In this work, we quantify the price of anarchy of non-profit utilities, that is, the cost caused by lack of coordination of users. We find that users, in the worst case, can consume up to twice the optimal demand, obtaining a small fraction of the optimal surplus. For this reason, we leverage the theory of mechanism design to design an incentive scheme that reduces the inefficiencies of the system, which preserves the privacy of users. We illustrate with simulations the efficiency loss of the system and show two instances of incentive mechanism that satisfy either budget balance and budget deficit.

Most security defenses can be breached by motivated adversaries, therefore in addition to attack-prevention technologies, firms investing in cyber-security for their information technology infrastructure need to consider attack-detection and restoration tools to detect intruders, and restore their system to a safe condition. Attackers face similar investment alternatives; they need to invest resources to finding vulnerabilities in a protected system, and once the protection has been broken, they need to invest in the infrastructure necessary to exploit these attacks and maintain stealthy persistence in the compromised infrastructure. We model this dual considerations as a dynamic programming problem between attackers and defenders and then study the Nash equilibrium of this game.

We analyze ways to detect attacks, and propose ideas to design the market in a way that attackers will not have an incentive to defraud the system.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
We illustrate the potential of applying population games in two key related problems in microgrids management: 1) economic dispatch of active and reactive power; and 2) demand response. For the dynamic economic dispatch problem, we present a hierarchical microgrid energy management algorithm able to dispatch active and reactive power dynamically. In the second case, we use an opinion dynamics model, including the market in which the network agents interact. Opinion dynamics considers individuals who shape their beliefs based on information they receive from a subset of the society and offers tools to analyze the outcome of collective decision processes, which apparently can be considered arbitrary. We propose an opinion dynamics model including some desired characteristics, such as prominent agents and environmental incentives.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
In this paper we identify some of the limitations with previous electricity cost functions used for demand-response (DR) programs in the retail market of the smart grid. In particular, we prove that while previous models lower the demand, they do not guarantee that they will try to flatten the demand. We then introduce a new nonlinear piece-wise continuous electricity cost function to model the way several consumers (from small utilities to retail consumers) are billed for electricity consumption. We show that the new cost function lowers the peaks in DR programs and design new incentive mechanisms to ensure that distributed agents converge to the Pareto-efficient solution of the system. However, we prove that any incentives mechanism either imposes additional taxes or requires external subsidies to operate. The paper finalizes with two examples of such mechanisms.

Demand response systems assume an electricity retail-market with strategic electricity consuming agents. The goal in these systems is to design load shaping mechanisms to achieve efficiency of resources and customer satisfaction. Recent research efforts have studied the impact of integrity attacks in simplified versions of the demand response problem, where neither the load consuming agents nor the adversary are strategic.
In this paper, we study the impact of integrity attacks considering strategic players (a social planner or a consumer) and a strategic attacker. We identify two types of attackers: (1) a malicious attacker who wants to damage the equipment in the power grid by producing sudden overloads, and (2) a selfish attacker that wants to defraud the system by compromising and then manipulating control (load shaping) signals. We then explore the resiliency of two different demand response systems to these fraudsters and malicious attackers. Our results provide guidelines for system operators deciding which type of demand-response system they want to implement, how to secure them, and directions for detecting these attacks.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are monitored and controlled by a wide variety of sensors and controllers. However, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that most of the devices interacting with the physical world (sensors and controllers) are extremely fragile to security incidents. One particular technology that can help us improve the trustworthiness of these devices is software attestation. While software attestation can help a verifier check the integrity of devices, it still has several drawbacks that have limited their application in the field, like establishing an authenticated channel, the inability to provide continuous attestation, and the need to modify devices to implement the attestation procedure. To overcome these limitations, we propose CPS-attestation as an attestation technique for control systems to attest their state to an external verifier. CPS-attestation enables a verifier to continuously monitor the dynamics of the control system over time and detect whether a component is not behaving as expected or if it is driving the system to an unsafe state. Our goal in this position paper is to initiate the discussion on the suitability of applying attestation techniques to control systems and the associated research challenges.

We prove the inefficiency (in the sense of Pareto) of the electricity system, as well as its resemblance with the tragedy of the commons. Also, we present a mechanism intended to achieve efficiency in the electricity consumption by means of economic incentives. The proposed incentives might be seen as an indirect revelation mechanism, in which users do not have to reveal private information about their preferences. Instead, a particular incentive is calculated for each user, based solely on its relative consumption. We conclude that the success of the proposed mechanism requires subsidies from external institutions, at least during the transition between an inefficient outcome and the efficient equilibrium.

We study controllability and stability properties of dynamical systems when actuator or sensor signals are under attack.

In one case-study we use a basic differential game, and in the other case study we introduce a heuristic game for stability.

The analysis of these properties is made in the context of network populations with or without the presence of prominent agents and environmental incentives. Some simulation results illustrate the ideas presented in this paper.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
This paper presents an approach for time varying non-linear channel equalization based on fuzzy systems and single-neuron training. The method consists of two stages: the first one uses supervised learning in order to determine channel states and to provide an initial tuning of the fuzzy equalizer parameters. The second one dynamically adjusts the equalizer to follow the varying behavior of the channel through unsupervised learning. This proposal is compared with a radial basis network over the equalization of a time-varying communication channel reported in previous works. Experiments are carried out through Monte Carlo simulations. Results show that the proposed approach presents a performance than that of a radial basis function in terms of the bit error rate of a communication system.
