New technologies of smart grids improve the decision making capabilities of users; however,
without a proper coordination the selfish behavior of users can degrade the the efficiency of
electricity markets (this phenomenon is also known as the tragedy of the commons or the
price of anarchy). My research focused on designing economic incentives to coordinate the
demand of customers and reduce the market’s efficiency loss. I found that, unlike competitive
markets, in regulated markets the efficiency loss can be arbitrarily large. Also, without
coordination users can consume at most twice the optimal amount of energy. To mitigate
such negative results I leveraged the mechanism design theory (or inverse game theory) to
propose an incentive mechanism that improves the efficiency of the market.
