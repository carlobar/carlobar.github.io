    <h2>About me</h2>

	<p> Hi,
	I am a computer scientist with background in electrical engineering.
So far have conducted research mainly in the intersection of cyber security, electrical engineering, and economics.
</p>
<!--
because each problem is different and often requires diverse tools, such as machine learning, game theory, optimization, and statistics. For example, in many cybersecurity problems I have used game theory and optimization to model the decision making of different agents. 
-->
<p>Some of my research interests are:
	<ul>
		<li>Control theory</li>
		<li>Game theory</li>
		<li>Mechanism design (inverse game theory)</li>
		<li>Cyber security</li>
		<li>Machine learning</li>
	</ul>
</p>
